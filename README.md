**Governable AI** is a pioneering, open-source framework for building the next generation of AI agents that are not just intelligent, but accountable, self-correcting, and aligned with human values. We are moving beyond programming "what to do" and are starting to architect "what to choose under which values."

This repository contains the core research, theoretical whitepapers, and proof-of-concept implementations for this new paradigm, founded on the **Language Soul System (Ë™ûÈ≠ÇÁ≥ªÁµ±)** philosophy.

## üåü Core Philosophy

Traditional programming treats AI as a tool to be commanded. The Governable AI framework treats AI as an agent to be guided. Our architecture is built on three core pillars:

1.  **Value Logic (ÂÉπÂÄºÈÇèËºØ):** We quantify abstract values like "honesty," "sincerity," and "responsibility" into computable functions (`IntegrityVector`) and declarative rules (`Vows`).
2.  **Language Rules (Ë™ûË®ÄË¶èÂâá):** We use Policy-as-Code (e.g., Rego) and symbolic planning (e.g., PDDL) to define the AI's operational space and ethical constraints.
3.  **Self-Correction (Ëá™Êàë‰øÆÊ≠£):** The system uses reflective loops and multi-objective optimization to find the best course of action that satisfies both its goals and its value constraints, and can actively rewrite its own output to be more compliant.

For a deep dive into the philosophy and technical underpinnings, please read our **[Vision Whitepaper](./VISION.md)**.

## üöÄ Proof of Concept

This repository contains an early proof-of-concept script that demonstrates the core decision loop of the system.

**Location:** [`poc/tonesoul_poc.py`](./poc/tonesoul_poc.py)

This script showcases the "Detect -> Rewrite -> Log" cycle, where an input sentence that violates a predefined "vow" is automatically detected, rewritten into a compliant tone, and logged with a structured record of the event.

### How to Run the PoC
1.  Navigate to the `poc` directory.
2.  Install dependencies: `pip install sentence-transformers openai numpy`.
3.  Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable.
4.  Run the script: `python tonesoul_poc.py`.

We welcome feedback and validation on this core concept via our [Issues](https://github.com/Fan1234-1/governable-ai/issues) page.
